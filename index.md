### Installing Everest
- If you've updated Celeste or switched betas / branches, delete the `orig` directory where Celeste is installed.
- [**Download the latest `build-XYZ-stable.zip`**](https://ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/lollyde/index.html)
    - If you just want to use Everest without issues, **download the latest `-stable` build.**
    - If you want to help testing the newest updates _and are okay with bugs_, download the latest build.
<!--    - Milestone GitHub releases are updated _very slowly_ (currently not at all), but are present [here.](https://github.com/EverestAPI/Everest/releases) -->
- Extract `build-XYZ.zip` to where Celeste is installed. `Celeste.Mod.mm.dll` should be right next to `Celeste.exe`
- Run `MiniInstaller.exe`
    - Linux / macOS users: Run `mono MiniInstaller.exe`

### Installing mods
- Move the mod `.zip` into the `Mods` directory where Celeste is.
    - For prototyping: Feel free to use a subdirectory instead of a `.zip`
- That's it. No need to extract anything.
