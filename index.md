Everest is an [open-source](https://github.com/EverestAPI) mod loader and modding API, making texture replacements, custom level sets and endless code mods a reality.

## Installing Everest
- If you've **previously installed Everest and updated Celeste** or switched betas / branches, delete the `orig` directory where Celeste is installed.
- [**Download the latest `build-XYZ-stable.zip`**](https://ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/lollyde/index.html)
    - If you just want to use Everest without issues, **download the latest `-stable` build.**
    - If you want to help testing the newest updates _and are okay with bugs_, download the latest build.
- Extract `build-XYZ.zip` to where Celeste is installed. `Celeste.Mod.mm.dll` should be right next to `Celeste.exe`
- Run `MiniInstaller.exe`
    - Linux / macOS users: Run `mono MiniInstaller.exe`

## Installing mods
- Find a mod on [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/celeste/)
- Move the mod `.zip` into the `Mods` directory where Celeste is.
    - For prototyping: Feel free to use a subdirectory instead of a `.zip`
- That's it. No need to extract anything.
