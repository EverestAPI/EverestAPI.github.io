Crossover Collab is an add-on fan-made mod for Celeste, not a standalone product. Note that mods do not work for Microsoft Store copies of the game!<\/li><\/ul><\/ul><ul><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Can I play this on my Switch or other console?<\/b><br><\/li><ul><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"2\">Unfortunately,\r\n no. Crossover Collab requires the Everest mod loader, which is desktop \r\nonly. However, it is playable on the Steam Deck<b>,<\/b> in desktop mode.<\/li><\/ul><\/ul><ul><li><b>Is there any additional content?<\/b><\/li><ul><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"2\">Feel free to replay maps that you enjoyed after you clear them for the first time.

Celeste\u2019s \r\nAssist Options are compatible with Crossover Collab, so you can \r\nadjust the difficulty to suit your preferences. While it is recommended \r\nto have completed at least the main story of Celeste, you can directly \r\ndive in the easiest maps.<\/li><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"2\">Most of the \r\nmaps expect you to be familiar with several techs, especially at \r\nmiddle-high difficulties, but all new mechanics are taught.<\/li><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"2\">If you need additional info about generic movement and techs, you can visit the Gyms in Strawberry Jam/Spring Collab/other mods.<\/li><\/ul><\/ul><b><\/b><ul><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>I\u2019ve already played Strawberry Jam, will the difficulty scale be the same?<\/b><br><\/li><ul><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"2\">While\r\n the general difficulty categories of Crossover Collab are similar to \r\nStrawberry Jam, the maps may not follow the exact same difficulty \r\nboundaries \r\nas you\u2019re used to. Certain optional secrets may be more than one star \r\nabove the rest of the difficulty of the map.<\/li><\/ul><\/ul><ul><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>So many games!

These stars are found on the title banners in the Map \r\nLaunchers. If you're new to a certain difficulty or modding in \r\ngeneral, we recommend trying out maps marked green on their meters first\r\n for a smoother experience.<\/li><\/ul><\/ul><ul><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Help!

Celeste\u2019s Assist Options are fully compatible with Strawberry Jam, so you can adjust the difficulty to suit your preferences. Additionally, several maps in the Beginner Lobby don\u2019t get any more difficult than Celeste\u2019s Summit chapter, so you don\u2019t need to have completed the B-Sides or Farewell to dive in.<br><\/li><\/ul><\/ul><b><\/b><ul><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>I\u2019ve already played Spring Collab, will the difficulty scale be the same?<\/b><br><\/li><ul><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"2\">While the general structure of Strawberry Jam is very similar to Spring Collab, each lobby may not follow the exact same difficulty boundaries as you\u2019re used to.<br><\/li><\/ul><\/ul><ul><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>So many maps! Where should I start?<\/b><br><\/li><ul><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"2\"> Every map has a meter that corresponds to its difficulty within the lobby, from <span class=\"GreenColor\"><b>green<\/b><\/span> (easier) to <span class=\"RedColor\"><b>red<\/b><\/span> (harder). These meters are found on the title banners of the map, and in the journal. If you're new to a certain difficulty or modding in general, we recommend trying out maps marked green on their meters first for a smoother experience.<br><\/li><\/ul><\/ul><ul><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Help!
