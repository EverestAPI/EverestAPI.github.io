    "Text": "So after a few months of sitting on this map I decided to release it. This is a short ~5 room map originally made for the now concluded Storytelling Competition. Difficulty is somewhere around expert, it uses the normal tech you would expect featuring a new mechanic. <br><br>The idea of the map was to make a short self contained story and translate it with the map but it wasn't coming out the way I wanted. I removed the dialogue but hopefully you can still experience the story through the environment. There were some neat ideas here that I still liked so I decided to post it after finishing a couple things. <br><br>Thanks to Litchbaulb for originally hosting the contest!

Crossover Collab is an add-on fan-made mod for Celeste, not a standalone product. Note that mods do not work for Microsoft Store copies of the game!<\/li><\/ul><\/ul><ul><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Can I play this on my Switch or other console?<\/b><br><\/li><ul><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"2\">Unfortunately,\r\n no. Crossover Collab requires the Everest mod loader, which is desktop \r\nonly. However, it is playable on the Steam Deck<b>,<\/b> in desktop mode.<\/li><\/ul><\/ul><ul><li><b>Is there any additional content?<\/b><\/li><ul><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"2\">Feel free to replay maps that you enjoyed after you clear them for the first time.

Celeste\u2019s \r\nAssist Options are compatible with Crossover Collab, so you can \r\nadjust the difficulty to suit your preferences. While it is recommended \r\nto have completed at least the main story of Celeste, you can directly \r\ndive in the easiest maps.<\/li><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"2\">Most of the \r\nmaps expect you to be familiar with several techs, especially at \r\nmiddle-high difficulties, but all new mechanics are taught.<\/li><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"2\">If you need additional info about generic movement and techs, you can visit the Gyms in Strawberry Jam/Spring Collab/other mods.<\/li><\/ul><\/ul><b><\/b><ul><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>I\u2019ve already played Strawberry Jam, will the difficulty scale be the same?<\/b><br><\/li><ul><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"2\">While\r\n the general difficulty categories of Crossover Collab are similar to \r\nStrawberry Jam, the maps may not follow the exact same difficulty \r\nboundaries \r\nas you\u2019re used to. Certain optional secrets may be more than one star \r\nabove the rest of the difficulty of the map.<\/li><\/ul><\/ul><ul><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>So many games!

These stars are found on the title banners in the Map \r\nLaunchers.

Some berries are more difficult than Farewell. If you can beat the C-Sides and Farewell you probably will be able to get through this. I would recommend being comfortable / practiced with wallbounces and wavedashes before playing this map, as you'll likely find it less frustrating.<br><br><b>Tech required<\/b>: Wallbounces, wavedashing, hypers, etc. Nothing that you haven't had to do in Farewell or the C-sides.

I didn't really intend to make harder maps, just wanted to explore some of the concepts of the main chapter further here.<br>Tech required: Same as main map.
