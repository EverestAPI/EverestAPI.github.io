Celeste\u2019s \r\nAssist Options are compatible with Crossover Collab, so you can \r\nadjust the difficulty to suit your preferences. While it is recommended \r\nto have completed at least the main story of Celeste, you can directly \r\ndive in the easiest maps.<\/li><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"2\">Most of the \r\nmaps expect you to be familiar with several techs, especially at \r\nmiddle-high difficulties, but all new mechanics are taught.<\/li><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"2\">If you need additional info about generic movement and techs, you can visit the Gyms in Strawberry Jam/Spring Collab/other mods.<\/li><\/ul><\/ul><b><\/b><ul><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>I\u2019ve already played Strawberry Jam, will the difficulty scale be the same?<\/b><br><\/li><ul><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"2\">While\r\n the general difficulty categories of Crossover Collab are similar to \r\nStrawberry Jam, the maps may not follow the exact same difficulty \r\nboundaries \r\nas you\u2019re used to.

This is partly because I probably have not the ability to deal with long maps. This is the latest version updated to gamebanana.

Some berries are more difficult than Farewell. If you can beat the C-Sides and Farewell you probably will be able to get through this. I would recommend being comfortable / practiced with wallbounces and wavedashes before playing this map, as you'll likely find it less frustrating.<br><br><b>Tech required<\/b>: Wallbounces, wavedashing, hypers, etc. Nothing that you haven't had to do in Farewell or the C-sides. Neutrals are disabled. <b><span class=\"GreenColor\">No advanced tech beyond that of the C-Side & Farewell is required for full completion<\/span><\/b><br><br>SEASONSIDES<br>------------<br>Aka Glyph B-sides, but four of them. Added as individual chapters following the main map.<br>~95 rooms across the new chapters<br>No berries, no secrets in these, just level.<br>Difficulty: around same difficulty or slightly harder than  the main experience. I didn't really intend to make harder maps, just wanted to explore some of the concepts of the main chapter further here.<br>Tech required: Same as main map. Neutrals are still disabled. <br><br>VOID-SIDE (ALL SEASONS MIX)<br>-----------<br>The void-side now has a cassette at the conclusion of the chapter which unlocks a new level. It's just more void, if you wanted more of that style gameplay you might enjoy these rooms.<br>~30 rooms<br>No berries, though a golden berry challenge does exist.<br>Difficulty: Around the same as the other void rooms. Hope you enjoy!<br>Tech required: Same as main map.

I did this because I think this map in particular plays better without them. I recognize that this Is controversial, especially for very experienced players. But all I can ask is that you approach the map with an open mind!<br>- <b>Debug mode will probably break things, use at your own peril<\/b><br>- Photosensitive mode enabled might make the transitions between rooms a little funky looking but that's okay. I recommend keeping photosensitivity mode disabled if you do not require the feature and it is safe for you to do so.<br>- Yes, if it isn't obvious already, I love Fez and Hyper Light Drifter, and I draw a lot of inspiration from those games and music.<br><br>CONTACT<br>---------------<br>I'm receptive to feedback if its actionable so do give me a shout if you find bugs or have any issues!<br>Reach out to me on discord if you'd like at marshall#9018<br>Or email me at mwhatters@gmail.com<br>If you want to use this music for anything please ask first!<br>cheers xoxo<br><br>",
