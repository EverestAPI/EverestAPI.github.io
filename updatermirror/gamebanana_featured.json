However, it is playable on the Steam Deck<b>,<\/b> in desktop mode.<\/li><\/ul><\/ul><ul><li><b>Is this an official release or DLC for Celeste?<\/b><br><\/li><ul><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"2\">No. Strawberry Jam is a fan-made modding project.<\/li><\/ul><\/ul><ul><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>I feel it will be too difficult for me.

Celeste\u2019s Assist Options are fully compatible with Strawberry Jam, so you can adjust the difficulty to suit your preferences. Additionally, several maps in the Beginner Lobby don\u2019t get any more difficult than Celeste\u2019s Summit chapter, so you don\u2019t need to have completed the B-Sides or Farewell to dive in.<br><\/li><\/ul><\/ul><b><\/b><ul><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>I\u2019ve already played Spring Collab, will the difficulty scale be the same?<\/b><br><\/li><ul><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"2\">While the general structure of Strawberry Jam is very similar to Spring Collab, each lobby may not follow the exact same difficulty boundaries as you\u2019re used to.<br><\/li><\/ul><\/ul><ul><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>So many maps! Where should I start?<\/b><br><\/li><ul><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"2\"> Every map has a meter that corresponds to its difficulty within the lobby, from <span class=\"GreenColor\"><b>green<\/b><\/span> (easier) to <span class=\"RedColor\"><b>red<\/b><\/span> (harder). These meters are found on the title banners of the map, and in the journal. If you're new to a certain difficulty or modding in general, we recommend trying out maps marked green on their meters first for a smoother experience.<br><\/li><\/ul><\/ul><ul><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Help!
