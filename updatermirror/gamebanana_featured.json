I went into this map trying to make player decisions feel more meaningful, so it's possible some rooms will require more intensive neuron firing action (or not lol). Honestly I'm not really sure if I achieved this goal but it was still fun to make regardless! So I hope it is fun to play as well woohoo<br><br>Features:<br>- 25~ gameplay rooms<br>- High octane techless experience<br>- An amazing custom soundtrack by TyKim!<br>- Light worldbuilding mmm :drool:<br>- Pink spinners<br>- I'm running out of things to say<br><br>Special shoutouts to Tykim who was so amazing and awesome and agreed to make the song for the map at such short notice. Sorry for canonically killing you in the map. Oops, that's a spoiler<br><br><b>Make sure to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4iCiZdVdXM\" target=\"_blank\">check out the OST here<\/a> and show him lots of love <3<\/b><br><br>Glhf!

Celeste\u2019s Assist Options are fully compatible with Strawberry Jam, so you can adjust the difficulty to suit your preferences. Additionally, several maps in the Beginner Lobby don\u2019t get any more difficult than Celeste\u2019s Summit chapter, so you don\u2019t need to have completed the B-Sides or Farewell to dive in.<br><\/li><\/ul><\/ul><b><\/b><ul><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>I\u2019ve already played Spring Collab, will the difficulty scale be the same?<\/b><br><\/li><ul><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"2\">While the general structure of Strawberry Jam is very similar to Spring Collab, each lobby may not follow the exact same difficulty boundaries as you\u2019re used to.<br><\/li><\/ul><\/ul><ul><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>So many maps!

These meters are found on the title banners of the map, and in the journal.

It's just more void, if you wanted more of that style gameplay you might enjoy these rooms.<br>~30 rooms<br>No berries, though a golden berry challenge does exist.<br>Difficulty: Around the same as the other void rooms. Hope you enjoy!<br>Tech required: Same as main map. Neutrals are still disabled. <br><br>DEPENDENCIES<br>-----------<br>Frost Helper (<a href=\"https://gamebanana.com/gamefiles/9201\">https://gamebanana.com/gamefiles/9201<\/a>)<br>Extended Variants Mode (<a href=\"https://gamebanana.com/gamefiles/9486\">https://gamebanana.com/gamefiles/9486<\/a>)<br>Glyph Audio (<a href=\"https://gamebanana.com/gamefiles/11936\">https://gamebanana.com/gamefiles/11936<\/a>) <br><br>DISCLAIMERS<br>------------<br>- <b><span class=\"RedColor\"><span class=\"RedColor\"><span class=\"GreenColor\">Neutrals are force disabled via extended variants<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/b>. I did this because I think this map in particular plays better without them. I recognize that this Is controversial, especially for very experienced players. But all I can ask is that you approach the map with an open mind!<br>- <b>Debug mode will probably break things, use at your own peril<\/b><br>- Photosensitive mode enabled might make the transitions between rooms a little funky looking but that's okay. I recommend keeping photosensitivity mode disabled if you do not require the feature and it is safe for you to do so.<br>- Yes, if it isn't obvious already, I love Fez and Hyper Light Drifter, and I draw a lot of inspiration from those games and music.<br><br>CONTACT<br>---------------<br>I'm receptive to feedback if its actionable so do give me a shout if you find bugs or have any issues!<br>Reach out to me on discord if you'd like at marshall#9018<br>Or email me at mwhatters@gmail.com<br>If you want to use this music for anything please ask first!<br>cheers xoxo<br><br>",
