This is partly because I probably have not the ability to deal with long maps. This is the latest version updated to gamebanana. No extra update included, even in the future.<br>In the end, I'll express my sincere gratitude those friends who have helped me on this project. This is the end of a past period.

Some berries are more difficult than Farewell. If you can beat the C-Sides and Farewell you probably will be able to get through this. I would recommend being comfortable / practiced with wallbounces and wavedashes before playing this map, as you'll likely find it less frustrating.<br><br><b>Tech required<\/b>: Wallbounces, wavedashing, hypers, etc. Nothing that you haven't had to do in Farewell or the C-sides. Neutrals are disabled. <b><span class=\"GreenColor\">No advanced tech beyond that of the C-Side & Farewell is required for full completion<\/span><\/b><br><br>SEASONSIDES<br>------------<br>Aka Glyph B-sides, but four of them. Added as individual chapters following the main map.<br>~95 rooms across the new chapters<br>No berries, no secrets in these, just level.<br>Difficulty: around same difficulty or slightly harder than  the main experience. I didn't really intend to make harder maps, just wanted to explore some of the concepts of the main chapter further here.<br>Tech required: Same as main map. Neutrals are still disabled. <br><br>VOID-SIDE (ALL SEASONS MIX)<br>-----------<br>The void-side now has a cassette at the conclusion of the chapter which unlocks a new level. It's just more void, if you wanted more of that style gameplay you might enjoy these rooms.<br>~30 rooms<br>No berries, though a golden berry challenge does exist.<br>Difficulty: Around the same as the other void rooms. Hope you enjoy!<br>Tech required: Same as main map. Neutrals are still disabled. <br><br>DEPENDENCIES<br>-----------<br>Frost Helper (<a href=\"https://gamebanana.com/gamefiles/9201\">https://gamebanana.com/gamefiles/9201<\/a>)<br>Extended Variants Mode (<a href=\"https://gamebanana.com/gamefiles/9486\">https://gamebanana.com/gamefiles/9486<\/a>)<br>Glyph Audio (<a href=\"https://gamebanana.com/gamefiles/11936\">https://gamebanana.com/gamefiles/11936<\/a>) <br><br>DISCLAIMERS<br>------------<br>- <b><span class=\"RedColor\"><span class=\"RedColor\"><span class=\"GreenColor\">Neutrals are force disabled via extended variants<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/b>. I did this because I think this map in particular plays better without them. I recognize that this Is controversial, especially for very experienced players. But all I can ask is that you approach the map with an open mind!<br>- <b>Debug mode will probably break things, use at your own peril<\/b><br>- Photosensitive mode enabled might make the transitions between rooms a little funky looking but that's okay. I recommend keeping photosensitivity mode disabled if you do not require the feature and it is safe for you to do so.<br>- Yes, if it isn't obvious already, I love Fez and Hyper Light Drifter, and I draw a lot of inspiration from those games and music.<br><br>CONTACT<br>---------------<br>I'm receptive to feedback if its actionable so do give me a shout if you find bugs or have any issues!<br>Reach out to me on discord if you'd like at marshall#9018<br>Or email me at mwhatters@gmail.com<br>If you want to use this music for anything please ask first!<br>cheers xoxo<br><br>",
