While it is recommended \r\nto have completed at least the main story of Celeste, you can directly \r\ndive in the easiest maps.<\/li><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"2\">Most of the \r\nmaps expect you to be familiar with several techs, especially at \r\nmiddle-high difficulties, but all new mechanics are taught.<\/li><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"2\">If you need additional info about generic movement and techs, you can visit the Gyms in Strawberry Jam/Spring Collab/other mods.<\/li><\/ul><\/ul><b><\/b><ul><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>I\u2019ve already played Strawberry Jam, will the difficulty scale be the same?<\/b><br><\/li><ul><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"2\">While\r\n the general difficulty categories of Crossover Collab are similar to \r\nStrawberry Jam, the maps may not follow the exact same difficulty \r\nboundaries \r\nas you\u2019re used to.

Some berries are more difficult than Farewell. If you can beat the C-Sides and Farewell you probably will be able to get through this. I would recommend being comfortable / practiced with wallbounces and wavedashes before playing this map, as you'll likely find it less frustrating.<br><br><b>Tech required<\/b>: Wallbounces, wavedashing, hypers, etc. Nothing that you haven't had to do in Farewell or the C-sides.

I didn't really intend to make harder maps, just wanted to explore some of the concepts of the main chapter further here.<br>Tech required: Same as main map. Neutrals are still disabled. <br><br>VOID-SIDE (ALL SEASONS MIX)<br>-----------<br>The void-side now has a cassette at the conclusion of the chapter which unlocks a new level.
