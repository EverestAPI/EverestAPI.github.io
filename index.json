    "keywords": "Your First Code Mod <!-- TODO: Get > [!PREREQUISITES] working --> PREREQUISITES Everest: Website Visual Studio 2015 or newer. MonoDevelop instructions are different. NuGet, either for your IDE, or CLI. Visual Studio 2017: Included Visual Studio 2015: Download NuGet.Tools.vsix Linux / macOS: CLI version included with Mono. Windows: Download nuget.exe Optional: git, either CLI or GUI client (f.e. GitHub Desktop ) Project setup Every Everest code mod starts out as a C# (.NET Framework) class library targeting the .NET Framework 4.5.2 (same as Celeste itself). Create a new project. In the top bar, select .NET Framework 4.5.2 In the left bar, select Installed > Visual C# Select the template Class Library or Class Library (.NET Framework) ( not Standard , Core , Portable , Universal Windows , ...). Name your mod appropriately and create it in a new solution. Create a new directory for the solution. The dialog should look like this: Adding Everest and Celeste Now that you've created a new, empty project, it's time to add the Everest API. Adding Everest files If your new project is a git repository, add Everest as a submodule. git submodule add https://github.com/EverestAPI/Everest.git Otherwise, download the Everest source code .zip ( master , stable ) and place it as Everest in your project directory. The file layout should look similar to this: Adding Everest project In Visual Studio, right-click the solution and add the existing Everest project. Navigate to where your project is, then into the Everest submodule, then Celeste.Mod.mm, then the matching .csproj project file. Afterwards, right-click on Celeste.Mod.mm and build it. Everest (Celeste.Mod.mm) should now exist as a project in your solution like this: Note If the compiler complains about the nuget packages not being found, right-click the references, select \"Manage NuGet packages...\" and restore them. Adding References Everest comes with most of its dependencies in the lib and lib-stripped subdirectories. lib contains all libraries ready to be used by your mod as-is. lib-stripped contains copies of a select few game binaries, stripped with mono-cil-strip . They don't contain any executable code and only contain the definitions for you to compile against. Note Everest mods are built with the FNA branch of Celeste to make use of its API extensions and for cross-platform compatibility. Everest will relink your mod from FNA to XNA at runtime. Right-click your project's \"References\" and select \"Add Reference...\", then set up the references so that they look like in the following screenshot: Note MMHOOK_Celeste.dll is automatically generated when you install Everest. Copy it from your Celeste directory to your project directory and add it as a reference. Important Make sure to go into the properties of each included reference and set \"Copy Local\" to \"False\", otherwise Visual Studio will include outdated / conflicting copies in your mod. Important If you want to maintain cross-platform compatibility, make sure to remove any .NET Framework references not on this list. System System.Configuration System.Core System.Data System.Drawing (available, but behaves unpredictably) System.Runtime.Serialization System.Security System.Xml System.Xml.Linq This means: Microsoft.CSharp, System.Windows.Anything, System.IO.Compression and other libraries are not available on Linux / macOS. For an up-to-date list, check the list of precompiled MonoKickstart libraries , as Celeste uses them for Linux / macOS. Module class Your module class should look similar to the example. Note This example only shows a subset of Everest's capabilities. Read the full EverestModule documentation here. // Example usings. using Celeste.Mod.UI; using FMOD.Studio; using Microsoft.Xna.Framework; using Monocle; using Celeste; using System; using System.Collections; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Text; using System.Threading.Tasks; namespace Celeste.Mod.Example { public class ExampleModule : EverestModule { // Only one alive module instance can exist at any given time. public static ExampleModule Instance; public ExampleModule() { Instance = this; } // If you don't need to store any settings, => null public override Type SettingsType => typeof(ExampleSettings); public static ExampleSettings Settings => (ExampleSettings) Instance._Settings; // If you don't need to store any save data, => null public override Type SaveDataType => typeof(ExampleSaveData); public static ExampleSaveData SaveData => (ExampleSaveData) Instance._SaveData; // Set up any hooks, event handlers and your mod in general here. // Load runs before Celeste itself has initialized properly. public override void Load() { } // Optional, initialize anything after Celeste has initialized itself properly. public override void Initialize() { } // Optional, do anything requiring either the Celeste or mod content here. public override void LoadContent() { } // Unload the entirety of your mod's content, remove any event listeners and undo all hooks. public override void Unload() { } } } Settings / SaveData class Your settings class should look similar to the example. Save data classes are very similar, but inherit from EverestModuleSaveData and the Setting* attributes are ignored. Note All entries must be properties , unless you're overriding LoadSettings and SaveSettings / LoadSaveData and SaveSaveData to bypass YamlDotNet's restrictions. This example only shows a subset of Everest's capabilities. Read the full EverestModuleSettings documentation here. For all settings attributes, search for Celeste.Mod.Setting in the Everest API. // Example usings. using Celeste; using System; using System.Collections; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Text; using System.Threading.Tasks; using YamlDotNet.Serialization; namespace Celeste.Mod.Example { // If no SettingName is applied, it defaults to // modoptions_[typename without settings]_title // The value is then used to look up the UI text in the dialog files. // If no dialog text can be found, Everest shows a prettified mod name instead. [SettingName(\"modoptions_examplemodule_title\")] public class ExampleModuleSettings : EverestModuleSettings { // SettingName also works on props, defaulting to // modoptions_[typename without settings]_[propname] // Example ON / OFF property with a default value. public bool ExampleSwitch { get; set; } = false; [SettingIgnore] // Hide from the options menu, but still load / save it. public string ExampleHidden { get; set; } = \"\"; [SettingRange(0, 10)] // Allow choosing a value from 0 (inclusive) to 10 (inclusive). public int ExampleSlider { get; set; } = 5; [SettingRange(0, 10)] [SettingInGame(false)] // Only show this in the main menu. public int ExampleMainMenuSlider { get; set; } = 5; [SettingRange(0, 10)] [SettingInGame(true)] // Only show this in the in-game menu. public int ExampleInGameSlider { get; set; } = 5; [YamlIgnore] // Don't load / save it, but show it in the options menu. [SettingNeedsRelaunch] // Tell the user to restart for changes to take effect. public bool LaunchInDebugMode { get { return Settings.Instance.LaunchInDebugMode; } set { Settings.Instance.LaunchInDebugMode = value; } } public int SomethingWeird { get; set; } = 42; // Custom entry creation methods are always called Create[propname]Entry // and offer an alternative to overriding CreateModMenuSection in your module class. public void CreateSomethingWeirdEntry(TextMenu menu, bool inGame) { // Create your own menu entry here. // Maybe you want to create a toggle for an int property? } } } Hooking Methods You should only care about the following two ways to hook methods: Everest.Events: This is a very restricted event listening method built into Everest, and is only used when Everest needs to do work behind the scenes for you. You can't control when the original method runs. MMHOOK_Celeste.dll: This auto-generated file allows you to hook to all Celeste methods as if they were events. You are responsible to run the original method. Also, you need to install Everest on the OpenGL / FNA version of the game to auto-generate a working .dll , otherwise you'll need the Windows-only and obsolete XNA Framework to even compile your mod. Take a look at an example in GhostNet here. If you're interested in lower-level runtime detouring, take a look at HookedMethod.Hook , available via NuGet. Make sure to set it and its dependencies' \"Copy Local\" property to \"False\", as Everest provides them for you. If you're interested in the lowest level of detouring, take a look at MonoMod.RuntimeDetour , which also powers MMHOOK_Celeste.dll ."

    "title": "Mod Structure | Everest",
    "keywords": "Mod Structure <!-- TODO: Get > [!PREREQUISITES] working --> PREREQUISITES Everest: Website Zipping software, f.e. 7zip: Website Formats Everest currently supports the following formats: Mod .zip s: Best used when using other's mods or when uploading your mod somewhere. Mod subdirectories: Best used for prototyping mods on your own machine. A mod can't contain \"submods\", unless a code mod loads the \"submods\" dynamically. A mod .zip shouldn't contain the content in a subdirectory. All of its contents should be accessible on the top level (root) by just opening the .zip file. Note A code mod can dynamically load external mod content and mod assemblies. Dynamically loaded mods aren't restricted by the above formats, but rather by how the \"supporting\" mod loads them. The following file layout still applies to dynamically loaded mods. File Layout Mods can contain custom content, both overrides / replacements (when supported) and new content. The content paths match the originals as close as possible. Mods must contain a everest.yaml metadata file. The following content mappings are supported out of the box: Graphics/Atlases/*.png : Replace or add textures. Supports .meta definition files. Graphics/Atlases/Gui/title.png Atlas: Gui Texture: title Graphics/Atlases/Gameplay/scenery/sign.png Atlas: characters Texture: scenery/sign Maps/*.bin : Add new maps. Supports .meta definition files. Replacing vanilla maps not supported. Maps/Author/LevelSet/1-Name.bin Default SID (String ID): Author/LevelSet/1-Name Default LevelSet: Author/LevelSet Default Name: 1-Name Dialog/*.txt : Add new texts. Only contains the texts belonging to the mod. Multiple mods are allowed to occupy the same path. F.e. two mods can contain their own Dialog/English.txt files. Replacing existing texts not supported. Dialog/English.txt is always used when a dialog key cannot be found in another language. Audio/*.bank + Audio/*.guids.txt : Add new FMOD audio banks containing custom / replacement events. Works with new banks created in the Celeste FMOD project Requires manually exported GUIDs.txt , renamed to your bank name.guids.txt To replace the game's events, assign any modified events to your new mod bank. Please avoid overriding the game's original banks. With a few exceptions, each file path can only be occupied by one file. If mod #1 contains Graphics/Atlases/Gui/title.png and Graphics/Atlases/Gui/title.meta.yaml , it overrides the texture shipped with Celeste. If an additional mod #2 contains Graphics/Atlases/Gui/title.png , it overrides the texture shipped with #1. The meta definitions of #1 still apply. All \"supported\" mod content can be loaded with the usual Celeste methods. For example, a texture in an atlas can be accessed with the matching atlas. All \"unsupported\" mod content can be loaded by codemods via Everest.Content.Get* (usage) . For content inside of .zip s and subdirectories, all mod content is directly contained in the .zip / subdirectory. For example, the mod .zip should directly contain a Maps directory. The Maps directory should not be in a Content subdirectory. For content in form of embedded resources inside of .dlls , all mod content requires a Content\\ path prefix Embedded resources normally don't have logical file paths in the traditional sense - the C# compiler mangles the filepath into something C#-friendly. To fix content embedded into .dlls, set a logical name for all Content\\ <EmbeddedResource> s in your .csproj : <EmbeddedResource Include=\"Content\\Dialog\\English.txt\"> <LogicalName>Content\\Dialog\\English.txt</LogicalName> </EmbeddedResource> Additionally, for embedded resources, the C# compiler requires filepaths with \\ as the directory separator, but the content is accessed with / as the directory separator. Everest replaces all \\ symbols with / symbols in embedded resource paths at runtime. Metadata The everest.yaml file in your mod contains a list of all \"module\" names (ID), version, (optional) DLL paths and any dependencies. If you've got no mod DLLs, leave that field out. If you've got multiple modules in separate DLLs, list them separately. The version should match the semver (semantic versioning) format : The MAJOR version must match to prevent breakages caused by API changes (f.e. API removals). The MINOR version must rise with each backwards-compatible API change (f.e. API additions). If the mod depends on a new version but an older version is installed, the mod won't load. The PATCH version isn't checked. Adding a dependency to a mod with version 0.0.* ignores the above checks at your own risk. Examples Code Mod File list: everest.yaml GhostMod.dll GhostNetMod.dll Embedded resources: Content\\Dialog\\English.txt : Mod option texts. Metadata: - Name: GhostMod Version: 1.2.1 DLL: GhostMod.dll Dependencies: - Name: Everest Version: 1.0.0 - Name: GhostNetMod Version: 1.3.4 DLL: GhostNetMod.dll Dependencies: - Name: Everest Version: 1.0.0 - Name: GhostMod Version: 1.2.1 The mod will load with Everest 1.0+.* , meaning 1.0.* , 1.1.* , 1.2.* , ... The mod won't load with Everest older than 1.0.0 . The mod won't load with Everest 2.*.* , 3.*.* , 4.*.* or similar. The API has changed in a way that could break the mod. Level Mod File list: everest.yaml Dialog/English.txt : LevelSet and chapter names. Maps/Cruor-Secret.bin : A-side map binary. Maps/Cruor-Secret.meta.yaml : Chapter metadata. Always the .meta of the A-side binary. Maps/Cruor-Secret-B.bin : B-side map binary. The A-side / chapter .meta links to this. Graphics/Atlases/Gui/areas/secret.png , secret_back.png : The chapter selection screen icon and its backside (when flipping). Graphics/Atlases/Gameplay/decals/cruor-secret/*.png : Any decals used by the A-side or B-side map .bin s. Graphics/Atlases/Ending-Cruor-Secret-1/*.png , ...: Chapter completion screen textures. The chapter .meta links to this."
