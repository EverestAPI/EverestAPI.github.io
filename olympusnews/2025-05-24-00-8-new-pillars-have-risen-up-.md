title: 8 New Pillars Have Risen Up!

---

Totem Collab has just released with 30+ maps ranging from Green Beginner to Red Grandmaster! In this collab, groups of 2-5 maps share a common theme & a similar entity palette. For example, a beginner map for the Totem of Industry may be a bit puzzly with how it uses factory pistons & gizmos, but an expert map for the same totem will lean much more towards hectic contraption gameplay. If this sounds exciting, check it out below!
