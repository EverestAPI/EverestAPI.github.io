title: Throwback Thursday 019 - Gauntlet (Re)Revamped

---

Percussive, the developer of String from Spring Collab, developed the orginal Gauntlet map over 6 years ago & revamped it a year later in Gauntlet Revamped, a small hub of short, cycle-based challenges with plenty of different environments! Today, FasolTheBean has revamped it again, making it a bit more accessible & clean yet still undeniably classic, old-school cycle gameplay! Check it out in the link below!
