title: Download Issues

---

Due to temporary changes on GameBanana, downloading mods in Everest or Olympus might not work.

---

Following a DDoS attack, GameBanana set up network filtering that have impacts on the Celeste modding tools:
- the mods listed in the "Download Mods" section aren't updated since around Oct 29, 1am UTC
- mod downloads might fail, you can work around this by picking a mirror in Options & Updates, or downloading mods
manually from the GameBanana website and dragging them into the Olympus window
