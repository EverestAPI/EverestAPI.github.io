Touhoe here to finally announce that the Modded Celeste Awards will be held live on Saturday, 2:00 PM EST at the Celeste Modding Central youtube channel linked below! This livestream won't be about tearing down or propping specific people up on a pedestal, but instead celebrating all the incredible, thoughtful, and beautiful art that modders pour tens, hundreds, or even thousands of hours to create! I hope you give the event a chance and have some fun in the upcoming festivities :peaceline~2:
