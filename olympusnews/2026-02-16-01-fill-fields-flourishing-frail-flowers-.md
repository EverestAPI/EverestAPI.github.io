title: Fill Flat Fields Flourishing Frail Flowers!

---

Don’t let the name “Asteraceae Barrens: Part 1” fool you, this Campaign Contest entry is plenty massive on its own! In each of the 4 expert-grandmaster chapters, you learn a new custom mechanic centered around planting flower markers. Keeping you company are over 45 minutes of custom music and hundreds of gorgeous visual assets! Take your green thumb to the gym in the link below, and don’t forget to check out some of the other Campaign Contest entries like kalypso’s feather precision jaunts in Cathartic Moments & Rajukebox’s intermediate adventure in Stardust Odyssey!
