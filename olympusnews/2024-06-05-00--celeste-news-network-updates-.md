Hi! Maddie here, I'm the manager of the #celeste_news_network subscription service and I'm hijacking Olympus News real quick to give some updates ðŸ˜…
As you probably noticed, the celeste_game Twitter account is back on Celeste News Network ðŸŽ‰ I'm using a third-party service that offers an RSS feed to do this.
If you subscribed but are not interested in Twitter, there is a new option on the subscription service, so you can decide if you want to receive Olympus, Twitter and/or Mastodon news on your webhook. You can split those up in multiple channels if you want, by registering multiple webhooks with different options ðŸ˜„
If you want to subscribe or update your subscription, get your webhook URL ready and click the link below!
