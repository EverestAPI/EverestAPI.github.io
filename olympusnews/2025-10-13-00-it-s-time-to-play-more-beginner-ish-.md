Nyx is a techless low intermediate map all about creating new cycles by stopping time for a brief moment. Each tree & cabin in this village teaches a new mini-lesson about this quirky custom mechanic. Spanning 40+ rooms, take your time & appreciate the sights as you hop from roof to roof under a beautifully tranquil moonlight. Download the map & take your well-deserved breather in the link below!
