Hello everyone! I am announcing that I am stepping down from the Olympus News writter position. You may have noticed that upload release times have been spotty at best recently, and I think I've decided it's my time to step away. I'm super honored I got to work with so many people to promote a bunch of amazing maps! You guys are super awesome! Super duper big thanks to maddie480 as none of this would have gotten of the ground without her. Don't forget how cool you are! I am also planning to step down from the GameBanana moderator position in the near future as well.

Don't get the wrong idea, I am not leaving the community! Just stepping down to focus more on school and life. My DMs are always open for those who need a level playtested or want to chat!

I drew a silly picture as a retirement gift to myself... I hope it's not too sad! Have a great day everyone, byeeeee!
