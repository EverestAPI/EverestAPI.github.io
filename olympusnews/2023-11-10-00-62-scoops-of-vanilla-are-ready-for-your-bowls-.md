title: 62 Scoops Of Vanilla Are Ready For Your Bowls!

---

Return to the base game's roots with Vanilla Contest, which just released today! Hosted by ABuffZucchini, this massive pack features 62 maps ranging from Beginner to Low Grandmaster and custom lobby music by nascence. You probably aren't quite prepared for all of the groundbreaking & tasty ways in which vanilla entities can be used, but that's okay! Make sure to grab your spoon-shaped keyboard/controller before you melt!
