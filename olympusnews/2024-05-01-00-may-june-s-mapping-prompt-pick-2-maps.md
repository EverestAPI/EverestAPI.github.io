title: May & June's Mapping Prompt - Pick 2 Maps

---

Here's yet another mapping prompt for tobyaaa and touhoe's bi-monthly system! The idea is "Pick Two Maps" - take two specific maps and combine them into something new. If you've mapped before, you probably have a load of maps in the scrap pile, and if you would like to use someone else's map, please obtain permission from the original mapper first! A video describing how it works is linked below!
