title: Throwback Thursday 14 - Into The Well

---

Throwback Thursday is the series that features maps older than a year that newer players may have missed. This issue features Into The Well by  Emmabelotti, which released December 4th, 2021. Based of the game Downwell, this ahead of it's time experience will blow your socks off. It features 5 main areas, 4 original music tracks by Ceph, and a ton of custom visuals! Unlock custom palettes and find silly secrets as you travel through the depths of the well. If I haven't convinced you, Maddy Thorson herself has played this map! Check it out with the link below!
