Celeste Sightreading Competition is a weekly race hosted by touhoe, fonda1515, and Hydro where every Friday at 2 PM EST at Celeste Modding Central, you get to race a map blind (starting with a te_79 map)! Also, you have an additional 4 days to play whenever & submit an image of your journal to a form. Linked below is a website made by Aurora Aquir explaining a bit more about the event!
