title: The Winning MTC2 Map!

---

The Music Translation Contest 2 results are out, so it's time to showcase the top 3 winning maps here in Olympus News! First off, the 1st place entry (out of 124!) is bone skull by Donker19! Translating a song by glass beach featuring over 3000 lines of dialogue, this story-driven map takes you through a serene beach, a dilapidated neighborhood, and so much more. This map won for some very good reasons, which you can find out in the link below!
