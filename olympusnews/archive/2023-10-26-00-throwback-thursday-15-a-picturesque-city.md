title: Throwback Thursday 15 - A Picturesque City

---

Throwback Thursday is the series that features maps older than a year that newer players may have missed. This issue features Into A Picturesque City by Banana23, which released October 26th, 2022. That's exactly a year ago and was not planned at all. Isn't that cool? This is a short and cozy techless intermediate map. Originally for the City Contest, enjoy a beautiful art style hand crafted by the vibes master Banana23. Play it now with the link below!
