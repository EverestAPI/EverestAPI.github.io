title: 2024 Blind Race Maps Are Out!

---

Both The Climate Crisis, made for Fangame Marathon, and Jellyfish Trilogy, made for Fangame Summer Feast, are out! TCC was made mainly by Tear, Spooooky, and Ricky06 with music from TyKim, while Jellyfish Trilogy was made mainly by Holia with music from q_is_sleeping. Both have 15+ extremely polished rooms of grandmaster, and both can be found in the Gamebanana collection linked below. Feel free to test your routing prowess, good luck, and have fun!
