title: A Debug Puzzle Map?

---

FFFFF is a 50 room map using the debug F5 button that reloads screens as a primary mechanic! Each screen teaches you a new technique or interaction with short, clever, & very accessible puzzles (easier than dropzle, donâ€™t be shy!). Also, see if you can spot all the hidden F letters embedded into the deco! Go check it out in the link below!
