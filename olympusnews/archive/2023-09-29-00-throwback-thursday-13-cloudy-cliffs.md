title: Throwback Thursday 13 - Cloudy Cliffs

---

I apologize for the two week gap between issues, I have been getting adjusted to college :)

Throwback Thursday is the series that features maps older than a year that newer players may have missed. This issue features Cloudy Cliffs by  ABuffZucchini, which released August 15st, 2021. This map will have you flying through the air! But do not be scared, the birds are very friendly! This map has 10+ rooms across 2 checkpoints and 5 berries. It also features custom music. Good job ABuffZucchini! Take a flight with the wonderful birds with the link below!
