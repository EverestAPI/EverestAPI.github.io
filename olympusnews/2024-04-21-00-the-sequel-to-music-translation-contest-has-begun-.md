title: The sequel to Music Translation Contest has begun!

---

The goal of MTC 2, similar to the original MTC, is to express the emotions, feelings, vibes, etc. of a particular song in a Celeste map. When you close your eyes listening to your favorite song, what do you see? What do you feel? Map the colors you feel, the motion you feel, whatever you see in your mind, make it real.

MTC 2 will take place over a month, and you are required to make a C-Side length or longer map with any song of your choice. Check out the Gamebanana Jam page for the full rules!
