title: Ring, Ring… Hello? New Collab?!

---

In Telephone Collab, mappers created handed off a map room-by-room, each based on limited information of the last room, just like a game of telephone! The result: 6 dynamic & consistently surprising maps with red expert to red grandmaster gameplay (mostly all with expert tech though). After getting a hang of each style, you might even be able to guess who made which rooms! Go pick up the phone below, free of charge!
