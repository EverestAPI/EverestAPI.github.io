title: The Dawn of Whimsical Contests & Collabs!

---

2 projects open to mapping have just been announced: 3 Room Jaunt Contest & Tower Collab! 3 Room Jaunt Contest is exactly what it sounds like, and more details are on the Gamebanana jam page. Jaunty! Tower Collab is inspired by 100trap maps where each minimum size room is stacked vertically. You can submit quaint 10-room areas that quickly explore neat ideas in tight spaces! More details can be found in the link below! Lastly, the final bimonthly prompt from tobyaaa & touhoe is gonna be 'Making Friends'. Have fun mapping!
