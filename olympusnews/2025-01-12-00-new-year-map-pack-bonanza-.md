title: New Year Map Pack Bonanza!

---

This new year has brought a lot of celebration, festivity, and most importantly, epic map packs! In the past month, a couple Secret Santa-likes have released, including Secret Father Frost Collab from the Russian community with 16 maps, and Zucchinicord Secret Santa (from Zucchinicord) with 24 maps! Additionally, the Chinese community released the Lantern-Tea Contest 2024 (which is linked below) with 12 epic maps! With difficulties across the board, you can take a peeksy into any of these warm & frosty packs for a good time!
