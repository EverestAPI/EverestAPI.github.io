Hosted by Crispybag, Where The Wind Takes You is a flowy Expert-Grandmaster map with 39 different rooms from 39 different makers! The Grandmaster rooms are optional, and an additional layer of challenge lies in the guessing game you can play at the end of each checkpoint. Can you sniff out each mapper's personal style with a limited entity palette? Find out below!
