title: Tobyaaa's Mapping Prompt January 2024

---

It's time for the first mapping prompt! We're going to be doing these every other month, as a low-stakes version of a contest theme. For the month of January, if you're in need of a map idea, try and build something based off the theme "Locked Away". Perhaps this means a map with a lot of locked doors? Or maybe it ties into the story? Feel free to interpret this however you want! If you have questions, contact tobyaaa or touhoe on discord.
